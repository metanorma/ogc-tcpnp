=== Qualification Checklist â€“ Community Standards

The following is a list of questions that the submission team needs to answer in the affirmative prior to submitting community specification into the OGC.

. Does the submission team understand that copyright and intellectual property (PR) shall be vested or shared with the OGC? Note: If the plan is to move the document to Provisional or Full standard status, all IP shall be vested to the OGC.
. Does the submission team understand that if the candidate standard is approved as an OGC standard that life-cycle governance shall be vested with the OGC[1]?
. Is there sufficient evidence of broad implementation?
. Is the candidate standard unencumbered by any 3^rd^ party intellectual property?
. Is there method to determine compliance with the community standard? This could be an abstract test suite, a compliance test framework, clearly defined requirements, or other text in the document that describes compliance.

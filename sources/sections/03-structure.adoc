== Structure of the Technical Committee

The TC is the primary group where OGC standards are developed, discussed, approved, and maintained. The TC members are responsible for the development and maintenance of all standards and related technical documents. The TC membership includes Voting TC Members, non-voting TC Members, and Invited Guests.

The Technical Committee is comprised of three primary subgroups: the OGC Naming Authority, Working Groups (WG), and Subcommittees (SC) to:

* Evaluate and provide guidance on architecture issues;

* Carry out the development of new proposals;

* Evaluation of proposals; and

* Provide a forum for the discussion and documentation of requirements for interoperability.

WGs will be formed, carry out their work, and when their work is completed, be dissolved. Working Group Policies and Procedures are defined in <<policies-and-procedures-for-subgroups-of-the-tc>>.

NOTE: Proposals as used here is meant to be a general term to cover RFCs, Discussion Papers, Best Practices, and Engineering Reports.


[[ogc-naming-authority-ogc-na]]
=== OGC Naming Authority (OGC-NA)

The OGC Naming Authority (OGC-NA) controls the assignment of OGC Names to resources of interest in geographic information infrastructures. In the terminology defined in ISO 19135-1:2015, OGC-NA is the Control Body for the register of OGC Names: this document describes the framework of documents, registers and other resources required for OGC-NA to execute that role. There are separate OGC-NA Policies and Procedures.

[[subcommittee-sc-of-the-tc]]
=== Subcommittee (SC) of the TC

A standing group (organizationally, a subgroup of the TC) of individuals composed of members of the TC and Invited Guests, with a mission to provide recommendations to the TC in some general area. A Subcommittee (see <<OGCSC>>) does not generate a standard nor does it work on a standard.

SCs have Voting TC Member-only voting. As with all OGC groups, each Voting TC Member has only one vote per SC. SCs are long-standing entities with general portfolios or mission. OGC staff can chair TC SCs. Any OGC member can attend a SC meeting and participate.

A SC may be proposed by any TC member. The TCC shall determine whether the SC should be established and whether a charter is necessary.

[[working-groups-wgs]]
=== Working Groups (WGs)

A group (organizationally, a subgroup of the TC) of individuals composed of members of the TC and invited guests, with the specific intent of solving some particular interoperability problem or problems in a particular technology domain for recommendation to the TC. A Group is not a subcommittee as outlined by the Bylaws of the OGC.

There are two types of Working Groups in the TC:

* Domain Working Groups (DWGs) (<<OGCDWG>>); and
* Standards Working Groups] (SWGs) (<<OGCSWG>>).

The reason that there are two different type of Working Groups is due to the OGC Intellectual Property Policy (<<OGCIPR>>).

[[domain-working-group]]
==== Domain Working Group

A group (organizationally, a subgroup of the TC - <<policies-specific-to-a-domain-working-group>>) of individuals composed of members of the TC and invited guests, with the specific intent of discussing and/or solving some particular problem or problems in a particular domain or technology arena for recommendation to the TC. Key functions of the Domain Working Group (DWG) are to:

* Have a formal approved charter that defines the DWGs Scope of Work and estimated timeline for completion of the work (if applicable);
* Provide a forum for discussion and documentation of interoperability requirements for a given information or user community;
* Provide a forum to discuss and recommend document actions related to Interoperability Program Reports;
* Develop Change Request Proposals (CRPs) for existing OGC standards;
* Develop Engineering Reports with the intent seeking approval by the TC for release of these documents as OGC White Papers, Discussion Papers or Best Practices Papers;
* Informational presentations and discussions about the market use of adopted OGC standards.;
* Have all-member voting policies (unless otherwise stated); and
* Have missions and goals defined by the TC.

A DWG Does Not work on RFC submissions, candidate standards, or revisions to existing OGC standards. However, a DWG can develop change requests as document interoperability requirements that can then be submitted as work items to a SWG.

By default, a DWG will allow public collaboration, such as in teleconference, email discussions, or a public wiki. A DWG has the option to make a motion to the TC to remove public participation in the DWG.

[[standards-working-group-swg]]
==== Standards Working Group (SWG)

A group (organizationally, a subgroup of the TC) of individuals composed of members of the TC and invited guests with the specific intent of working on a candidate standard prior to approval as an OGC standard or on making revisions to an existing OGC standard. Please see <<policies-specific-to-a-standards-working-group-swg>> for details on the policies and procedures for SWGs. The following is a general overview.

Specific work items for a SWG could be:

* Have a formal approved charter that defines the SWGs Scope of Work and estimated timeline for completion of the work;
* Develop a new candidate standard in preparation of that document as an RFC submission.
* Process a new RFC submission candidate standard once approved by the OAB;
* Consider official Change Request Proposals to an existing OGC standard and make changes to the standard as necessary: from this perspective, a SWG does all the work that was formerly performed by a Revision Working Group;
* Approve a candidate standard for public comment;
* To vote on any changes to a candidate standard or to an existing OGC standard; and/or
* Make recommendations to the entire TC once a document is ready for a formal adoption vote;

Voting is limited to those Members who are either 1.) Charter Members of the SWG or 2.) have formally opted into the SWG and have waited the mandatory 30-day waiting period and requested to be voting members.

SWGs are persistent unless the SWG voting members decide otherwise and choose to dissolve the SWG once they have completed their work as described in their charter or choose to end the work.
